# Task Management

## A React task management app featuring Ant Design ui library

The app supports different states for a task: To do, Doing, Blocked, Done.
You may change the state of a task by drag and dropping it into wanted column on the board.
A new task may be created by pressing the corresponding button, then a modal window will appear, allowing the user to input all neccessary data for a task, that is: **title, description, status, priority, due date and assignee**.
