# Todo List

React todo list app with implemented mvp:

- Adding tasks with title and description
- Editing pending tasks, deleting them
- Changing completion status by a checkbox

Each task is instance of Task class with autogenerated fields like id and date:

```js
constructor(title, description) {
    this.id = uuidv4();
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description;
    this.createdAt = new Date();
    this.completed = false;
  }
```

Each time the task gets edited a new field of date appears showing when it was updated:

```js
update(title, description) {
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description ?? this.description;
    this.updatedAt = new Date();
  }
```

The shown list is ***sorted by date*** (newest first) and gives the user ability to ***filter the tasks by completion status***

---

To run the app navigate to react project folder and run using npm

```sh
cd react/todo-list
npm start
```
